```
Memes ⇒ Genes ⇒ Dreams = meme + Memepool + text
```

Memepool is the petri dish of internet culture. Uploading internet memes to the Memepool means detecting their structure. By utilising the `meme` package manager, it is possible to sync a collection to one’s personal computer. Thus, one becomes a meme scientist.
Memepool is the *dynamic archive* of memes. According to media theorist Wolfgang Ernst, a dynamic archive is the archetype for reconstructing reality algorithmically.
Although these postmodern times seem to be dialectical, ideologies gain a lot of power, especially those promoting a hyper-rational worldview. Cybernetics is one of them, calling itself scientific since its birth in the 20th century. Its main message: The material world works in exactly the same way as electric circuits.
