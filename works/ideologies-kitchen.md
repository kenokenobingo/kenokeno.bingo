Ideolgies are fragmenting. Those fragments are published on the internet by their followers, using platforms embedded in their ideolgies: Most of the internet’s infrastructure is based on capitalist and libertarian thinking.  
_ideologies.kitchen_ produces merch for all of those fragmented ideologies, being in that sense agnostic. The actual goals of _ideologies.kitchen_ are obviously of capitalist and libertarian nature: selling goods and providing an archive of the ideologies collected.
