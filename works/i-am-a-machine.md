[How to modernise Andy Warhol?](https://marilyn.kenokeno.bingo/) The postmodern Warhol is a machine, it is processing Marilyn with a computer. Thereby Marilyn gets different functions, aesthetics and charisma.
A file is destroyed on a low level in order to get an aesthetic output on the higher level. Generally, Warhol used the same principle. He used modern originals, adopting and arranging them in his special way of expression. Although he tried to imitate a machine, he made obviously mistake. In fact, this is what makes his works especially interesting. Maybe this is the main topic of Warholâ€™s works: mistakes.
