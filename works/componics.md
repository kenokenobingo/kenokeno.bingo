Componics is a framework, both technological and political for governing small agrarian communes. It’s based heavily on Degrowth and Murray Bookchin’s Social Ecology.  
  
Technology has an ideological quality. In order to design alternative technologies that address the world’s current problems instead of reinforcing them, we must consider how a social system can reflect this way of thinking. Climate change threatens the entire biosphere, including flora, fauna, and ultimately humanity. Unfortunately, a lack of global distributive justice limits the prosperity of the majority of people. How can ideologies such as post-growth and social ecology find representation in future technology? The low-tech, degrowth, commons, and open source movements are already developing concepts for designing alternative technological artifacts.
